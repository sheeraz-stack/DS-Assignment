    "- Model selection: Based on the problem statement and the nature of the data, you choose a suitable machine learning algorithm or model architecture. Consider factors such as the type of task (classification, regression, etc.), data size, data complexity, interpretability requirements, and computational resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model training: In this step, the chosen model is trained using the training dataset. The model learns patterns and relationships in the data by adjusting its internal parameters based on the input features and corresponding target labels. The training process typically involves an optimization algorithm that minimizes a loss or cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning: Many machine learning models have hyperparameters that need to be set before training. Hyperparameters are not learned from the data but are set by the user. To improve model performance, hyperparameters are tuned by selecting different values and evaluating the model's performance on the validation set. Techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be used for hyperparameter tuning.\n",

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are calculated to assess the model's performance. The evaluation provides insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
